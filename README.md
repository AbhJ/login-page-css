## Contribution

This project is very far from perfect, any contributions from you is very welcomed. You can help me with submit any issues you found, fixing any bugs, submit awesome login page design inspiration, or adding new login page by your self.
Let's create an awesome open source css template together!

## Notes for Contributors

- I suggest to not use real Logo for demo page, this is for avoid "phishing" perceptions.
- We also doesn't need to use all real assets, just focus on the layout.
- Use minimum JavaScript. You can add JS only for interactions.
- We doesn't need to replicate all state, e.g: errors, success, etc. But you can add it when you need.
- Please always put an additional footer, You can replace the author text with your own name and link.
